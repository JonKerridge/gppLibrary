/**
 * Map Reduce provides a set of processes that can be used to implement the 
 * Map-Reduce architecture, which is often used to integrate data from many 
 * different data sources distributed over a network.<p>
 * The package contains two processes Mapper and Reducer.  Reducer is 
 * capable of being nested so that the reduce operation can be intially 
 * undertaken locally and then over the network.<p>
